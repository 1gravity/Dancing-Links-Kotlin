**BruteForce.solveNoExtraRegions** is a fairly fast brute force solver that follows the tdoku_basic_heuristic solver here: https://t-dillon.github.io/tdoku but also supports jigsaw puzzles.

**BruteForce.solveWithExtraRegions** is a generalized version of the StandardSolver that works with extra regions (X-Sudoku, Hyper-Sudoku etc.).
